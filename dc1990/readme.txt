Summary Notes for STF 2 1990
STF 2: A, B, And C
-- A --
    Folder for each State
    Each state folder contains 3 parts: .FO1, .FO2, .FO3
        .F01 - Larger geography (incorporated / place)
        .F02 - Tract
        .F03 - Block Numbering Area (BNA)
    Within each (.F01, .F02, .F03), there are 2 segments for each geography & characteristic iteration combo. 
    Segment 1 and 2 have same break patterns, but different areas of filler. 
        Segment 1: first 300 are geography, followed by a break at every 9th character. (301, 310, 319, 328, etc). End filler starts at 5719 and goes to 5721
        Segment 2: first 300 are geography, followed by a break at every 9th character. (301, 310, 319, 328, etc). End filler starts at 3274. 
        Breaks can also be done so as to skip repeat of geography and combine the 2 segments
